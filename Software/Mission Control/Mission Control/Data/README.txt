This folder is missing the "maps" subdirectory, mainly because it's truly huge (about 600MB) - this cosists of OS .asc plaintext map files of the UK at 50m horizontal and +-5m accuracy vertical resolution, plus 1:250,000 map feature texture tiles. Will also include satellite photos, publicly accessible land maps, etc etc. May also add the USGS Space shuttle 1m resolution maps eventually, though that level of detail is almost certainly totally superfluous from 50,000ft.

If you really need it you can download it all off the OS website.
